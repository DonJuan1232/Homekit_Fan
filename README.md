# Homekit_Fan

Making my dumb fan a smart fan and controlling it using Homespan.

The fan is a WatsHome FD-75C

All you need to do this yourself is a:
1x esp32
1x MG996R servo motoro
wiring
5v 2amp power supply(I had this laying arround so I used that)


My approach for this project was to first make a 3d scan of the fan so that I could use that as a reference in Fusion 360. I then made a servo mount to attach to the fan. Since it is not moving much I just use friction to hold it in place on the fan. The servo is then screwed into the mount. After that I made a attachment for the servo so that it could reach and move the rotary switch on the fan.
After 3D printing all of this I wired everything together and started programming everything.s
